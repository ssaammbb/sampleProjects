Please watch the OutputVideo mp4 file for a demonstration of our program!

Learning Tool-

To install the learning tool, please go to the folder titled TheLanguageTool and then open the out folder.
There, you will find an installer for the learning tool. Install the program, and accept the 
option to make a desktop shortcut if you wish. Now you can open and use the learning app.

Please note, that to compile and run the learning tool code from an IDE, the Qt libraries must 
be included in your IDE's include directory path, and the Qt library files must be included in
your IDE's library path. To avoid this, simply use the given installer and run the .exe.

Image Processor-

To install the Image Processor, open the folder titled ProcessImgInstaller, and then open the 
installer folder. Then run the mysetup application. Now, you'll be able to run the image
processor.

In the image processor, there are two options. Press 1 to analyze an image, or 2 to print
the contents of the BST in spanish.

If you choose option 1, then type the name of one of the preloaded images.
Preloaded images are as follows: a.png, b.png, c.png, d.png, e.png, f.png, g.png, h.png, i.png,
j.png, k.png, l.png, m.png, n.png and o.png.
