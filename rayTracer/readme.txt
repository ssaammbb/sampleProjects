Raytracing Engine-

At present, the program can only be run by downloading the project and using the 'run' command in sbt shell. A .jar file allowing the project to be run on its own with user specified objects, lights, and camera position will be included in the future. To view sample output from the program, open 'drawing.png' in the rtScala folder.
