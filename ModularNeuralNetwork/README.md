# Modular Neural Network
This program implements a modular neural network, simalar to Sklearn's MLPClassifier. It supports a variety of cost functions, activation functions, optimizers, and strategies for parameter initialization. I am still actively working on this project, and I plan on adding a number of additional features and support for running on Nvidia GPUs with the Numba library. I apologize for the current state of this project as a bunch of python notebooks running on google colab, and this will be changed shortly.
# How to run
Due to being in between computers when creating this project, I created it using google colab. As a result, it currently must be run in colab (I will be updating that soon). To run the program as it currently stands, you must download the directory 'ModularNeuralNetwork' and add it to your google colab in the 'Colab Notebooks' directory. Now, the file 'ModularNN.ipynb' will be able to run properly. The final cell in the python notebook contains an example problem (exclusive-or) for the network to solve, or other training data can be uploaded and used. The entire notebook can be run by clicking runtime -> run all or pressing ctrl+f9 in colab.
